This means that, on Firefox, the Meet app can use only those selected devices and the rest of the devices you may have can't be selected.

If you want to change the selection you will need to grant the permissions again for the different devices you want to use.

This is a two-step procedure:

- You need to revoke previously granted permissions
- You need to grant permission for new devices you want to use

Once this is done just reload the page and you will be prompted again from a Firefox asking you again to select the devices you want to use going forward.
