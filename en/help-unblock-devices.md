# How to unblock your camera and microphone?

Every user joining for the first time to a Meet is being asked by a browser to grant access to camera and microphone which are needed so other participants can hear and see the user.

If a user will choose here **Block** action, then the Meet will be forbidden from accessing the camera and microphone

At this moment, Meet has no access to devices and can not even ask again for permission to be granted on its own. 
The only way Meet can access the camera and microphone at this moment is for a user to manually override the block and allow access.

This is done in 3 steps:
- User clicks on the small lock icon on the left side of the browser address bar
- User changes the state of camera and/or microphone permissions from **Block** to **Allow**
- User reloads the page
